# portfolio
In the development of my website/ future fashion company website/ portfolio, I followed a structure from the wireframes I created in adobe XD for a UX design class at Algonquin. My process began with the idea of the theme and the purpose of the website was all about showcasing what I would do if I were able to create a fashion website one day. I started with wireframing and chose to use a carousel on my home page to make the page look more futuristic. I also chose a clean and modern design for my creative ideas. The font was carefully considered to ensure that the content was easy to navigate and visually appealing but for the color scheme I mainly used white, black, pink, and orange as I thought it would go with what was trending right now like the Barbie movie. 
I faced challenges during the development phase. The main challenge was the nav bar / navigation menus relevant and accessible on different devices. Using Bootstrap helped me overcome this problem. Throughout the process I overcame these kinda problems by using bootstraps responsive and pre-styled components, as well as using CSS to customize certain parts of the website.
I learned the importance of planning and wireframing before moving into development. Also I was actually surprised that if I put my heart and soul into something I could really do all-nighters continuously for almost 3 days working on this website. Using bootsrap came in clutch as it accelerated development but also provided responsive and simple design elements.
I used the following properties and properties in creating this website.
•	Bootsrap
•	Animate.css
•	Ionicons
•	Google fonts
•	Used images from pexels which gave me no copyright pictures of the models
i used googles structured data markup helper for the schema roles
This wonderful experience has given me knowledge on how a website should be developed, its design, and the ability to use existing tools and resources to create user-friendly web experiences.
